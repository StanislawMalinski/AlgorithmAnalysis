# Algorithm Analysis

# Objective:
    Create program that will be able to analysis algorithm and provide the
    best model that will describe its complexity.

# Approach to the problem:
    1. The program will run a lot off simluation of the analyised algorithm. 
        After collecting data from those simulatuions, we will analysis the 
        result useing mathematical analysis and useing diffrent models we 
        will try to model complexity of the algorithm.
    
    2. The program will analysis not the statistical data, but will analysis
        pure code of the algorithm, and useing this aproch will enable us to
        calculate concrete values for complexity models.

# Pros, cons and differences between the approaches:
    1.
        Pros:
            - Faster to implement.
            - Is uniwersal for every programing language.
        
        Cons:
            - Is rather inaccurate.

    2.
        Pros:
            - Very accurate.
        
        Cons:
            - Much more demending and time consuming.
            - Works only with one programing language.
